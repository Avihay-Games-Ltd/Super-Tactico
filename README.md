### 2. Processes

The main goal of the game is to bring the opponent's flag to the island which is in your area (called base island). this target will be reach if you lead on of your land soldiers to load on himself the opponent's flag, sail with it on one of your ships to your base island and to unload it there.

The secondary goal, which can also lead to victory, is to kill as much as possible opponent's tools. If this goal is completely reached (That means all the opponent's tools have been destroyed) its consider also as a victory because the opponent in his turn cant excute any movement.

In some cases, the final result of the game will be draw.
For example, if all the ships of both player have been destroyed


* Start process -
The first process in the game, which the players gets a random tools set and they need to decide if they want to randomize another set or to stay with the set they got. the randomaization will be done by clicking on a buttton called "Randomize" (each player has his own button).
If the other player is a COM player, a randomization of the tools set will be done only if the human player randomize his set.

* Main process -  
In the main process of the game, both of the players move their tools to reach the main goal- catch the opponent's flag and bring it into your base island.
Each turn, one of the player moves one of it's tool to an available tile. 
The movement excuted by MouseClick on one of the tools.
After the clicking, all the available tiles to move towards will be marked by a red line that will surround them.
If the player choose one of the signed tiles, the tool will move to this tile and the turn wil be pass to the opponent.
If the player regrets and click on another tool, the available tiles of the new tool's movement will be marked, and the the previous soldier's available tiles will return to normal state.

* End process - 
The end process of the game starts when one of the players or both of them close to reach the main or the secondary goal.
Each player tries to bring the opponent's flag to his base island before the opponent will do so, and if he lost the chance to reach the main goal
(all his ships have been destroyed and he has no way to bring the flag to the island, or all his soldiers has been destroyed and he has no soldier to load the flag),
he tries to ruin the opponent plans to win.
